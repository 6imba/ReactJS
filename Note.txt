# Lifting up state in react:
    - In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”.

# Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. 
    - ChildComponent2 has placeholder for child_elements/components which is passed by ParentComponent1.

# Component composition:
    SignUpDialog() {
    <Dialog >
        jsx1
    </Dialog>

    Dialog(props) {
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
        jsx2
        {props.children}#jsx1
    </FancyBorder>

    FancyBorder(props) {
    {props.children}#jsx2
    }



# React, a Javascript library, uses unidirectional data flow (one way data binding).
	- React, a Javascript library, uses unidirectional data flow. The data from the parent is known as props. You can only transfer data from parent to child and not vice versa. This means that the child components cannot update or modify the data on their own, makeing sure that a clean data flow architecture is followed.
