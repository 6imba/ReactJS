# If we need to write/add HTML into page via JS, we used to use DOM api inside <script> tag.
    - but in React we have got JSX(JavaScript XML).

# JSX syntax/code:
    - HTML_script inside JavaScript.
    - HTML_script inside React_component_function.
        - write HTML_script inside React_component_function as a variable value or a return value.
    - JavaScript XML.
    - At the end, we can say that HTML is XML.
    - as react code is excuted, component's JSX is transformed into browser friendly code.

# You can say that JSX is the way/syntax you write HTML inside your React Component module file, which(jsx) later gets transformed into browser friendly code by reactJS.
    > component function can only return one element.(so, all the html element must be inside a root parent node element.) i.e: return <div><h1>hi1</h1><h1>hi2</h1></div>
    > () in component return will span the multiline code.
    > Expression inside html tag: attributr_key = {varaible}.

{["amir is ",23, " years old."]}
// react is capable of rendering array item as string.

- we can also store JSX_element in variable of function component.
    - It's not limited to use JSX inside return() only.

const ElementList_1 = () => {
    const intArr = [2,3,4,5,6]
    const elementArr = intArr.map(item => <li>{item}</li>) **********************************
    return elementArr;
}
