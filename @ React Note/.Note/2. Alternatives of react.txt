# React is a client-side component-based JavaScript library to built dynamically reactive user interface for websites/single_page_web_application.
    - Its component based UI library.
    - It's mainly developed to focus in component thing.
    - So it doesn't have other features built-in.
    - But if you needs other features to work with react component you have to install third-party library/package owning those other features.
    - like router for routing features, and so on.

# Like react we have other alternatives like angular_framework, vue_framework.

# React < Vue < Angular.
