> The key difference between props and state is that:
    - props are external and controlled by whatever renders/invokes the component while,
    - state is internal and controlled by the component itself.

    - Whereas Props can't (Immutable)
    - State can be changed (Mutable)

    - Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.
    - State holds information about the component.

    - Props can be accessed by the child component.
    - State cannot be accessed by child components.()

    - Stateless component can have Props.
    - Stateless components cannot have State.

    - Props make components reusable.
    - State makes components re-render when state changes.
