# Similarity:
    - Both hooks accepts a callback_function and a list of dependencies,

# Difference:
    - useMemo returns the memorized value returned by the passed function.It only recalculates the value when one of the dependencies changes.
    - useCallback returns the memorized version of the callback. It only changes the callback when one of its dependencies is changed.

    - useMemo only recalculates the value when one of the dependencies changes.
    - useCallback only changes the callback when one of its dependencies is changed.


# Code:
    > const doubleNumb1 = useMemo(() => input*2, [input])
    > console.log(doubleNumb1) 
    //Output: 2
    // useMemo return value calculated by callback

    > const doubleNumb2 = useCallback(() => input*2, [input])
    > console.log(doubleNumb2) 
    //Output: () => input * 2
    // useMemo callback function_defination/reference.

************************************************************************************************************************

- useMemo returns the memorized value, returned by the passed callback function.
- useMemo returns undefined incase callback has no return.
- useMemo only recalculates the value when one of the dependencies changes.
- Generally, useMemo only execute passed_callback_function when of the dependencies changes.
- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
- This will cause the function to only run when needed.

- useCallback returns the memorized version of the callback.
- useCallback re-create/define memorized version of the callback when one of the dependencies changes.
- Generally, useCallback only re-create/define passed_callback_function when of the dependencies changes.

- And here React.memo(), re-render the component wrapped inside it only when its dependencies(state,props,children) of that wrapped_inner_component changes. (children is also props)

- The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.
