- every time component gets re-render function inside component is re-declared/re-created.
- so when dealing with function we always have to consider reference equality.
- even though two function have the same behaviour/defination, it doesn't mean they are same.
- So function before re-render and after re-render are not same.
- So as handler function is prop in nested component, our nested component re-render even after React.memo
- means React.memo doesnt prevent re-render.
- So here comes the use of useCallback.
- which doesn't change_reference of handler function on every render until it'd dependencies changes.

- useCallback is the hook that returns the memorized version of callback function. (memorized_callback can be call as function_reference)
- memorized_callback changes only when any of its dependencies has changed.
- useCallback hook will cache callback function.

# Steps:
    - import useCallback hook.
    - create a cache function returned by useCallback function with dependencies.

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

- The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
- Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
- This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.
- The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
- This can improve performance.

- Solve the Problem:
- Reason to use React.memo() is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its dependencies(state,props) changes.
- Reason to use useCallback is to prevent re-declaring of function on every render unless it's dependencies mutates.
