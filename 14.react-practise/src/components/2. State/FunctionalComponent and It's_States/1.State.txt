    - to maintain(define/update) the state of a component use hook called useState.

        > import {useState} from 'react';
        > const [stateData, setData] = useState("initial value");
    - useState hook:
        - useState accepts an initial state
        - returns two values:
            - The current state.
            - A function that updates the state
