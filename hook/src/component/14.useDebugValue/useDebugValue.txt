- useDebugValue makes debugging React app easy when using ReactDebuggingTool chrome extension.
- useDebugValue hooks is used only inside custome hook.
- useDebugValue show debugged value into browser tool, only to the component(UseDebugValue_1) level to the custome hook.
- when you have multiple debugged value, ReactBrowserDebugger shows those value together inside an array.

# Performance of React app with useDebugValue hook:
    - As our useDebugValue get executed in production as its in out react-app-code .
    > useDebugValue(callback): 2.debug takes time.js #1
        - here callback might take long time to finish, which will make out react app wait and slow.
    > useDebugValue(value, callback): 2.debug takes time.js #2
        - So, instead we can pass two argument into useDebugValue hook. 
        - Here, callback will run only if we are in development or when our developer tool is opened.

# Question:
    - As our CustomeHook is also just a function as our other FunctionComponent or simply function. How does reack know which is CustomeComponent.
