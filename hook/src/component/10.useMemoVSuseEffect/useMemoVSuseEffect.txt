# useMemo() executes callback before rendering JSX, if given dependencies mutates.
# useEffect() executes callback after rendering JSX, if given dependencies mutates.

# Dependencies in both useMemo and useEffect:
    > none: on every render
    > []: for initial render
    > [dependencies]: only if particular dependencies mutates

# useEffect must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up.
